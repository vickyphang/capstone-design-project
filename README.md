# Water Vending Dispenser with RFID Based Payment System 🎓

So for the capstone design project, I created a water vending dispenser (just a prototype) to solve single-use plastic bottle waste problem ♻️.
This machine is designed to dispense water according to the amount of water paid by user.


Specifications:
- 💻 Raspberry Pi 3 as its processing module
- 💳 RFID reader module as its payment system
- 📺 7-inch capacitive touch screen LCD
- 🌊 Diaphragm water pump
- 📧 e-mail notifications when water runs out
- ☁️ 000webhost as database server to store user’s balance
- 🐍 Main code written in Python
- 🔨 GUI's are designed using PyQt5 framework
